Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.

### Discussion Questions

1. What challenges in the DREAMer movement are discussed in this chapter?
2. What do you see as a commonality between this movement and previous Latino activism? Hint: this is part of what Beltran argues in her book *The Trouble with Unity*
3. How did this movement differ from previous movements?
4. In her book, Beltran advocates for more deliberate forms of political participation and organizing. Meaning, places where people are continually talking and shaping what the group stands for.
    a. In what ways are the DREAMers an example of this?
    b. When thinking about your own advocacy (or potential advocacy), what similarities do you see between the DREAMers and other movements?
