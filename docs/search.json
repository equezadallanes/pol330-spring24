It is, however, not a collection of summaries about each article (that would be an annotated bibliography). Instead, a literature review conveys what these works say together and identifies gaps in the literature. In other words, it shows what we know about something but also highlights what we don’t yet know.\nFor this assignment, provide an introduction to the literature review. Tell the reader why this topic is important and how you will approach it (i.e., “In this literature review, I will discuss X, Y, and Z”)."

Remember that research questions can take different forms. For example, you might see the following:\n\nWhat is the effect of x on y?\nWhy do some people (community or policy) do one thing and others do another thing?\nHow does x relate to y?\n\nScholars have different preferences for how a question is best formulated, and the same question can be reworked to fit several constructions. For example, in a co-authored project my colleagues and I ask, “do Hispanic voters care if a political candidate speaks to them in Spanish and does it matter how proficient the candidate sounds?” This two-part question fits both the first and third examples. If we knew that some Spanish-language appeals from candidates are more successful than others, we could have asked, “why are some Spanish-language appeals effective while others are not?” Now it looks more like the second example.\nWhatever construction you choose for now, think about what kind of answer there might be to your questions and why. Choose something that interests you and that you really want to know.\n\n\nList of Literature\nSubmit a list of at least five peer-reviewed journal articles for your literature review or final paper.\nThe goal is to help you get started on identifying the literature you need to engage with for your research project. By conducting research, you are entering a conversation with other academics, so you must be familiar with the ideas and findings that are already out there."

Now, you have two keywords for your project that you can look up on an academic database (e.g., Google Scholar).\nExample: if I am interested on the relationship between national origin and partisanship among Latinos, I would want to search for “national origin,” “partisanship,” and “Latino.” I would try different combinations of these terms because you need to know the impact of national origin on different outcomes as well as the predictors of partisanship beyond national origin.\nAbout peer-review: The articles you cite must come from peer-reviewed journals. This means that these articles have been reviewed by scholars (other than the authors) who study similar topics and who have deemed the article, along with the journal editors, acceptable for publication."

We will then analyze historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and policies as well as Chicano social and labor movements.

The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Readings can be accessed through the library resources or, when not available through the library, via Canvas.\n\n\nCourse Workload\nThis is a 4-credit hour course, meaning that you are expected to spend 12 hours of work each week (including the 3 hours spent in the classroom). This roughly means that you will spend about 2 hours on readings for each class period, and 3 hours each week working on the different assignments (pace yourself!).\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n< 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (20%): All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have three unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. Note that students who are absent, whether excused or not, are still expected to submit the weekly summary corresponding to that class period.\n\nWeekly summaries (20%): Each week for eight (8) weeks, you will summarize one article from the week’s readings (the reading appears in bold font on the course website). Since there are 11 opportunities to write a summary in the semester, you can skip three of them. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas before class time on the day the reading was assigned.\nResponse paper (10%): Students will write a response paper (2 double-spaced pages, 12-point font) where they integrate the readings for a given week. In the response paper, you will highlight the connections between the readings, write about their applicability to the role of Latines in American politics today, and offer a critique of the readings as a whole. You may choose to focus more on applicability to today or a critique of existing research.\nCampaign memo (15%): Students will write a campaign memo for a Senate campaign on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Students must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latino voters. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\nOral Presentation (10%): Students will give an oral presentation based on research design paper. This will take the form of a conference presentation.\nResearch Design Paper (25% total): Students will propose a research design to answer a question of interest. This paper must include an introduction, a literature review that situates the present question in the broader field, an answer to the question (the argument/theory), and a proposed design to answer the question. Students should meet with the instructor to discuss the paper and think about how one might design a study to answer the question of interest. This paper will be broken down into different parts that will be due throughout the semester.\n\nPapers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized with one point off for each 24-hour period after the due date."

    "title": "Writing a Summary",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing a summary may seem to some like an easy task, while others might find it daunting. I think it’s both. Understanding what should go in a summary is crucial. This will not only help you write more useful summaries, but it will also help you become a more intentional reader.\nA summary should help you or someone else understand the main points of the piece as well as some of its context. It should answer the following questions:\n\nWhy is the text relevant? Why did the author(s) write it?\nWhat is the main conclusion of the text?\nHow do the author(s) reach their conclusions?\n(Optional, but useful) How does this work fit in with other texts or your observations?\n\nI would argue that a good summary for a journal article can be short (~5 sentences) or a bit longer (three-quarters of a page), depending on the level of detail that is required. For this class, anything in between these two lengths will suffice. I care much more about the content of the summary than its length.\n\nExample 1 - Abstracted structure of a summary\n\nThis is a little example of what a summary can look like (purpose/argument). Many students struggle to write summaries, and they end up outlining a text instead of summarizing the main points (context/relevance). To solve this, I am creating a page that includes questions a summary should answer, one abstract example of a summary, and two summaries of journal artices to help students write their summaries (method). Students read and referenced this page throughout the course (fingers crossed!) to write fantastic summaries of political science research (results). This shows that students only need a little guidance to achieve good results (implications).\n\n\n\nExample 2 - Summary of journal article\nIn the example below, I summarized this article:\n\nFrancis, R. W. (2006). Using Concept Maps as Assessment Tools: Defining Understanding. College Quarterly, 9(3), n3.1\n\nYou should be able to find the various parts highlighted above.\n\nThis article seeks to establish how concept maps can be useful for assessing understanding. Because concept maps structure knowledge, they can reveal how much students know and how they connect the ideas and concepts they have learned. To assess how many concepts and links between these concepts show understanding and breadth, the study uses upper-level education students and asks them to create concept maps for “effective teaching.” The resulting concept maps are divided into four levels and the conclusion is that concept maps that show breadth and depth of understanding have as many entries as the number of links to the main idea multiplied by ten. Although this research points in the opposite direction and its results do not seem generalizable (a good concept map may be denser or sparser depending on the discipline), it may be a good assessment tool and a way to show whether students who perform better have more structured, full concept maps.\n\n\n\nExample 3 - Longer summary of journal article\nThis example summarizes the following article:\n\nWald, Kenneth D., Dennis E. Owen, and Samuel S. Hill. 1988. “Churches as Political Communities.” American Political Science Review 82(2): 531–48.2\n\nAfter reading the summary, see if you can abstract the structure from the text.\n\nSummary\nWald, Owen, and Hill examine how an individual’s religious context affects their political attitudes. More specifically, the authors focus on how the religious beliefs of a congregation as a whole influence individual church members’ levels of moral conservatism and conservative ideology. Given the leadership structure and the repeated interactions between members of a church community, congregations represent a powerful social context for the dissemination of information and the enforcement of norms. As a competing explanation, the authors explore the influence of individual-level theology alongside congregational-level beliefs to ascertain whether an individual’s political attitudes are best explained by their own religious beliefs or those of their congregation.\nTo test their theory of congregational influence, the authors contacted churches in Gainesville, Florida, and obtained 657 completed surveys from 21 different congregations. The authors constructed a moral conservatism index by aggregating individual attitudes on issues such as abortion, homosexuality, birth control, drugs, and interracial marriage. Political ideology was measured through a standard self-placement measure on a 5-point scale, ranging from strongly liberal to strongly conservative. As their explanatory variable, theological conservatism taps into views about the Bible and evangelism as well as a respondent’s “born-again” experience. To obtain measures of moral, political, and theological conservatism at the congregation level, the authors calculate the average of the individual responses from each congregation.\nIn a series of multivariate regression analyses, the authors find that the more conservative the religious beliefs of a congregation the higher their levels of moral conservatism will be for both the congregation and the individuals. Although to a lesser extent, the same pattern holds when using political conservatism, measured through self-reported ideology, as the dependent variable. Additionally, while individual religious beliefs are also correlated with political attitudes, the impact of personal theology is not as large as that of the congregation’s theology. These results hold after accounting for individual-level characteristics such as partisanship, education, race, and age, and the possibility of individuals self-selecting into like-minded congregations. The findings underscore the importance of group-level influences on individual political attitudes.\n\n\nStructure\n\nThe first paragraph provides the main argument and tell us where the piece is situated in the literature.\nThe second paragraph tells us the methodology the authors use to evaluate their argument.\nThe third paragraph tells us the most important findings and what they mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis citation follows the APA citation style.↩︎\nThis citation follows the APSA citation style.↩︎"

    "title": "Peer Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Purpose\nPeer review is not only essential in the scientific community to check one another’s work, but it can also be a great tool in your own learning process. Doing peer review turns you into a serious reader who is trying to understand the main thesis of a piece of writing as well as the arguments. The goal is to provide feedback to help the writer convey their argument in a clear and concise manner.\n\n\nTask\nThere is no one definitive way to do a peer review, but in general you want read someone’s work and do the following:\n\nIdentify the thesis: Restate the main argument for the writer. In doing so you can offer a different, more effective phrasing (hopefully, it is the argument the writer wanted to make).\nList the major supporting points and evidence: Create a list of the main points and what evidence the writer offers. At this point, you have distilled their text into the main argument (thesis) and the supporting points.\nIdentify the most effective/convincing part of the text as well as the least effective: Tell the writer how effective you think each point is and whether the evidence they provide actually supports their argument.\nThink about the order of paragraphs and sentences: Do the main points seem out of place? Should one come first before the other? Are there sentences that are incomplete or points that need more explanation?\n\n\n\nUsing a Peer Tutoring Technique\nAfter many years of working in the writing center (both as an undergraduate and graduate student), I learned one technique that I used to start all of my sessions. This basically consists of asking the writer to do the task above while you read their paper and do the same.\n\nAsk the writer to write down the thesis and most important points they are wanting the reader to take away while you read their paper.1\nRead the paper and see if you can quickly identify the thesis, the supporting evidence, and the overall structure.\nCompare notes with the writer. I often asked the writer to go first and tell me what they were trying to communicate.\n\nIf the argument the writer tell us is not what you understood from their paper, tell them and find a way to make the argument clearer. (The argument is clear in the writer’s mind but not yet in the paper.)\nIf the writer cannot tell you a clear argument, it’s time to ask questions to help them clarify what they are arguing. (The argument is not yet clear in the writer’s mind.)\n\nOnce the main thesis is clearly articulated, I move on to the supporting points. I ask the writer, what are your main points? After hearing them, I try to locate them in the paper.\n\nEach point should be in the first sentence of a paragraph (the topic sentence).\nAs a general rule, I suggest the writer presents one point at a time. When you start a new point, start a new paragraph.\n\nSessions usually last no more than 40 minutes. So, before time is up, I ask the writer what they think are the next steps. It’s important that they know what the main areas they should focus on are and how to improve them.\n\nThe writer will hopefully mention specific areas or thing they need to do. (Your job is done!)\nIf the writer does not articulate clear next steps, offer some guidance.\n\nOffer encouragement. For example, “I agree! I think once you do these things, your argument will be much stronger”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI find this is really useful when thinking about cover letters or grad school applications. At the core, the question you should ask is, what do I want the reader to remember?↩︎"
