title: "Oral Presentation"
---

Your research presentations will take place during the week of April 22. Your presentation should be between 10-12 minutes, and there will be about five minutes for questions from your peers.


# Organization of the Presentation

Your presentation must include the following sections:

1. Motivation: use an example that shows why your question matters or some interesting data that captures the audience's attention

2. Research Question: this may come before or after the literature review (whatever you think works best in the flow of the presentation)

3. Literature Review: tell us what we know and what we don't know in a couple of slides.

4. Theory

5. Research Design

6. Implications and Conclusion
